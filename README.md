# GeneticOptimizer
Genetic algorithms are a type of evolutionary algorithm that mimic the process of natural selection to find optimal solutions to complex problems.

## Project Overview

The Genetic Optimizer Library is a Python library designed to enhance linear and logistic regression models by implementing a Genetic Algorithm for weight and bias optimization. Unlike traditional optimization methods like Gradient Descent, this library leverages the power of genetic algorithms to find optimal model parameters.

## Genetic Algorithm

A Genetic Algorithm is an optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection. It mimics the process of evolution to find the best solution to a problem. In the context of this library:

1. **Initialization**: A population of potential solutions is randomly generated. Each solution represents a possible set of model parameters.

2. **Fitness Evaluation**: A fitness function is defined to measure how well each solution performs in solving the problem. For regression tasks, this could be mean squared error (MSE) for linear regression or log-loss for logistic regression.

3. **Selection**: The top-performing solutions are selected based on their fitness scores. These solutions have a higher probability of being chosen for the next generation.

4. **Crossover**: Pairs of selected solutions are combined to create new solutions. This process mimics genetic recombination in nature.

5. **Mutation**: Some of the newly created solutions undergo random changes, simulating genetic mutations.

6. **Termination**: The algorithm continues to iterate through these steps for a specified number of generations or until a termination criterion is met (e.g., reaching a target fitness score).

## Library Components

The Genetic Optimizer Library consists of the following components:

### Linear Regression

The library provides a `LinearRegression` class that allows you to optimize the parameters of a linear regression model using a genetic algorithm. It follows the steps outlined in the Genetic Algorithm section to find the best weights and bias for the model.

### Logistic Regression

Similarly, the `LogisticRegression` class in the library optimizes the parameters of a logistic regression model using the same genetic algorithm approach. It seeks to find the optimal weights and bias for classification tasks.

## Getting Started

To use the Genetic Optimizer Library in your own projects, follow these steps:

1. Install the library using `pip install genetic-optimizer` (replace with the actual package name).

2. Import the relevant class (`LinearRegression` or `LogisticRegression`) from the library.

3. Create an instance of the class and use the `fit` method to optimize the model parameters.

4. Make predictions using the `predict` method.

5. Evaluate the model's performance and accuracy.
